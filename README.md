# Image-Classification

*Aim*: The aim of this project is to create, train and evaluate a neural network in TensorFlow, understand the basics of neural networks and solve classification problems with neural networks.

## Theoretical Overview

*TensorFlow:* 

*One Hot Encoding:*

## For Data Modelling  
       import numpy as np
                    
## For Data Visualization
       import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
                 
## For Neural Network 
       import tensorflow as tf 

## For Importing Dataset
       from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
                    
## For One Hot Encoding
       from tensorflow.python.keras.utils import to_categorical
                    
## For Creating the Model
       from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
       from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

## Name of the dataset : 
       MNIST
                    
## Tasks:
       Loading the data
       Perform One Hot Encoding
       Preprocessing
       Create model
       Train the model
       Evaluate the model
       Predictions

## For Data Visualization, I used:
       line plot
